# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## The Problem

When a class needs to be modified every time a new behavior is added, it violates OCP. Instead of modifying existing code, we should be able to extend it without changing its source.

## Bad Example

```java
public enum ShapType {
    CIRCLE,
    SQUARE,
    RECTANGLE,
}
```
```java
public class Shap {
    public ShapType type;
    public double radius;
    public double width;
    public double length;

    public double Area() {
        switch(type) {
            case CIRCLE -> {
                return radius * radius * Math.PI;
            }
            case RECTANGLE -> {
                return length * width;
            }
            case SQUARE -> {
                return width * width;
            }
            default -> {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Shape type not supported");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Why This Violates OCP

- **Every time we introduce new shape type, we have to:**
    - Modify the `Area` method.
    - Risk introducing bugs into existing logic.
- **This class is not closed for modification**, leading to fragile code and poor maintainability.

## Refactored Solution

Weâ€™ll apply OCP by introducing a common interface and making each shape type responsible for its own area logic.

1. `ShapeStrategy` - defines a contract for area calculation.

2. Concrete strategy classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle` and `Square`.

3. `AreaCalculator` - delegates the calculation to a strategy.

### 1. ShapeStrategy (Abstraction)

```java
public interface ShapeStrategy {
    public double Area();
}
```
- **Reponsibility**: Define a unified contract for area logic.

### Concrete Strategies (Behavior Extension)


```java
public class Circle implements ShapeStrategy {
    public double Area() {
        public double radius;
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}

public class Square implements ShapeStrategy {
    public double Area() {
        public double side;
        return side * side;
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements ShapeStrategy {
    public double Area() {
        public double length;
        public double width;
        return length * width;
    }
}
```

- **Responsibility**: Implement specific area logic per shape type.

### AreaCalculator (Delegation)

```java
public class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculate(ShapeStrategy strategy) {
        return strategy.Area();
    }
}
```

- **Responsibility**: Remain unchanged while allowing new shape types via strategy injection.
