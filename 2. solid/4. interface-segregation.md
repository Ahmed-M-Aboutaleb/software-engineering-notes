# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one large, “fat” interface, prefer several small specific interfaces.

## The Problem

When a class implements an interface containing methods it doesn’t need it:

- Carries unnecessary dependencies.

- Must provide dummy or empty implementations.

- Becomes harder to maintain and extend.

## Bad Example

```java
public interface Shape {
    public double area();
    public double volume();
}
```

```java
public class Sphere implements Shape {
    private double radius;
    public Sphere(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public double area() {
        return 4 * Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public double volume() {
        return (4 / 3.0) * Math.PI * radius * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public double volume() {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### Why This Violates ISP

- **Circle forced to implement unused methods**: Circles  don’t have volume.
- **Tight coupling**: Any addition to `Shape` breaks all implementers.

## Refactored Solution

We’ll break the fat interface into several focused interfaces, and let clients implement only what they actually support.

1. `Shape2D` - Defines 2d shapes.

2. `Shape3D` - Defines 3d shapes.

3. **Clients** implement only the interfaces they need.

### 1. Segregated Interfaces

```java
public interface Shape2D {
    public double area();
}

public interface Shape3D extends Shape2D {
    public double volume();
}
```

- **Responsibility**: Each interface has a single, cohesive purpose.

### 2. Focused Implementations

```java
public class Sphere implements Shape3D {
    private double radius;
    public Sphere(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public double area() {
        return 4 * Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public double volume() {
        return (4 / 3.0) * Math.PI * radius * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Circle implements Shape2D {
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

- **Responsibility**:
    - `Circle` only have area.
    - `Sphere` have area and volume.
