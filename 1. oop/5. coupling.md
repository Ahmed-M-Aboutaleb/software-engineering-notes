# Coupling

**Definition:** Coupling describes the degree of direct knowledge or dependence between software modules (classes, components, packages, etc.). High (tight) coupling means modules are strongly interlinked, so changes in one likely affect others. Low (loose) coupling means modules interact through well-defined, minimal contracts (e.g., interfaces), making them easier to change, test, and reuse.

## Bad Example

```java
// A concrete payment processor
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment of $" + amount);
        // ... actual logic (API calls, DB updates, etc.) ...
    }
}

// OrderService is directly instantiating and using a concrete PaymentProcessor
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // ... order validation, inventory checks, etc. ...
        double total = order.getTotalAmount();
        paymentProcessor.processPayment(total);
        // ... post-payment logic ...
    }
}
```

### Why it is bad

- **Tight coupling to implementation:**
`OrderService` creates a `PaymentProcessor` directly, so it is bound to that specific class.

- **Hard to swap implementations:** If you later need to use a different payment provider (e.g., `StripePaymentProcessor` vs. `PayPalPaymentProcessor`), you must modify `OrderService`.

## Refactored Solution

We reduce coupling by introducing an abstraction (interface) and injecting dependencies, so OrderService depends only on a minimal contract.

```java
// Abstraction for payment processing
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount) throws PaymentException;
}

// A concrete implementation for, say, a specific provider
public class StripePaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) throws PaymentException {
        // Connect to Stripe API
        System.out.println("Processing payment of $" + amount + " via Stripe");
        // ... actual Stripe logic ...
    }
}

// Another implementation (e.g., for testing or fallback)
public class MockPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Simulate success without real side effects
        System.out.println("Mock processing payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

// OrderService depends only on the PaymentProcessor interface
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;

    // Dependency injection through constructor
    public OrderService(PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor) {
        this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
    }

    public void placeOrder(Order order) throws PaymentException {
        // ... order validation, inventory checks, etc. ...
        double total = order.getTotalAmount();
        paymentProcessor.processPayment(total);
        // ... post-payment logic ...
    }
}
```
