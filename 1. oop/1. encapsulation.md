# Encapsulation

**Definition:** Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP principles. It refers to bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components. This is usually done by marking fields as `private` and exposing controlled access through public methods like getters and setters.

## Bad Example

```java
public class BankAccount {
    public double balance;

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

### Why it is bad

- **No access control**: Anyone can modify the balance field directly (account.balance = -1000), possibly putting the object in an invalid state.

- **No validation**: There's no check on whether the withdrawal amount is valid (e.g., sufficient balance).

- **Violates encapsulation**: Internal data is completely exposed, no logic controls how it is accessed or modified.

## Refactored Solution

- **Fields are private**: External code cannot directly modify balance.

- **Controlled access**: Balance can only be changed through validated methods.

- **Preserves object integrity**: Ensures that only valid operations can be performed on the data.

- **Improves maintainability**: Business rules and constraints are encapsulated within the class.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial balance must be non-negative.");
        }
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdraw amount must be positive.");
        }
        if (amount > balance) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Insufficient balance.");
        }
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```
