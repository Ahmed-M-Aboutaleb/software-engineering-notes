# polymorphism

**Definition:** Polymorphism is an OOP principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface or base type. It enables a single interface or method call to operate on objects of various types, with each type providing its own implementation of the behavior.

## Bad Example

Imagine we have several animal classes, but the client code distinguishes between them manually:

```java
public class Dog {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}

public class Bird {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Tweet!");
    }
}

public class AnimalSoundPlayer {
    public void playSound(Object animal) {
        // Manual type checking instead of polymorphism
        if (animal instanceof Dog) {
            ((Dog) animal).speak();
        } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
            ((Cat) animal).speak();
        } else if (animal instanceof Bird) {
            ((Bird) animal).speak();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unknown animal");
        }
    }
}
```

### Why it is bad

- **Type checks and casts:** The client must know about every concrete class and use `instanceof` and casting.

- **Violation of Open/Closed Principle:** Whenever a new animal type is added (e.g., Cow), we must modify `AnimalSoundPlayer.playSound`, adding another `instanceof` branch.

- Tight coupling: `AnimalSoundPlayer` depends on concrete classes `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`. Changes in those classes or new classes force changes here.

## Refactored Solution

We apply polymorphism by defining a common abstraction (interface or base class) that declares the operation (`speak`). Each concrete animal implements it. The client code depends only on the abstraction.

### 1. Define a Common Interface

```java
public interface Animal {
    void speak();
}
```

- **Responsibility:** Declare the contract for making a sound. Clients can refer to Animal without knowing specific types.

### 2. Implement Concrete Classes

```java
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}

public class Bird implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Tweet!");
    }
}
```

### 3. Client Code Uses Polymorphism

```java
public class AnimalSoundPlayer {
    public void playSound(Animal animal) {
        // No type checks needed; just call the interface method
        animal.speak();
    }
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Animal> zoo = List.of(
            new Dog(),
            new Cat(),
            new Bird()
        );

        AnimalSoundPlayer player = new AnimalSoundPlayer();
        for (Animal a : zoo) {
            player.playSound(a);
        }
    }
}

```
